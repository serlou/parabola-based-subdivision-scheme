# A single uniform non-linear subdivision scheme to reproduce any non-uniform polynomial data

This repository includes:
1. MATLAB implementation of a uniform subdivision scheme that reproduces parabolas on non-uniform grids.
2. Mathematica notebook with symbolic computations used in the results of [1].

Subdivision schemes are efficient tools to generate curves from a sample of points. This particular scheme was designed to deal with data describing smooth curves in R^n, N>=2. More information about this scheme can be found in [1].
